Author: Alfonso Rojas Mora

## General description
This repository contains a course on statistical inference with R for biology and natural sciences students. The course goes through the basics of R coding and rapidly moves into data handling and visualization, using the tidyverse and ggplot.
This course is intended for bachelor students, and covers basic statistical inference. It includes t-test, linear regression, one- and two-way analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and p-value adjustment for multiple testing in post-hoc analyses.

## /Cheat_sheets
